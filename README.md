This Project focuses on predicting the Employee's burnout rate using a dataset downloaded from kaggel website containing various features and attributes related to burnout symptoms.By analyzing the data, implemented a supervised machine learning model that can predict the burnout rate of employees of a specific organisation accuratley.

---
### DataSet Information
The dataset consists of parameters such as date of joining, gender, company type, WFH setup availability, designation, resource allocation, and mental fatigue score.
Understanding what will be the Burn Rate for the employee working in an organization based on the current pandemic situation where work from home is a boon and a bane. How are employees' Burn Rate affected based on various conditions provided?
***
### Objective
The objective of this project is to raise awareness about mental health issues that an organisation's employees face and mobilize efforts in support of mental health. According to an anonymous survey, about 450 million people live with mental disorders that can be one of the primary causes of poor health and disability worldwide. These days when the world is suffering from a pandemic situation, it becomes really hard to maintain mental fitness.

### Inspiration
Try to build some really amazing predictions keeping in mind that happy and healthy employees are indisputably more productive at work, and in turn, help the business flourish profoundly.
***
### Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training. Here a wide variety of supervised machine learning algorithms have been used to analyse the dataset behaviour and different techniques, how well they can predict the burnout rate of employees and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.

### Impact
Understanding what will be the Burn Rate for the employee working in an organization based on the current pandemic situation where work from home is a boon and a bane. How are employees' Burn Rate affected based on various conditions provided?
This can significantly helpful for the organisation to put extra efforts to reduce the stress that their employees experiencing which may results in organisations productivity positively.
